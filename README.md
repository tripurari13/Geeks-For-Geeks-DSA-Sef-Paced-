Rod Cutting Problem

This C++ project implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the classic rod cutting problem. Given a rod of length n and a table of prices for sublengths, the goal is to determine the maximum possible revenue obtainable by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces.

Features:

Dynamic programming: Uses a bottom-up approach to efficiently calculate the maximum value for each rod length.
Clear and concise code: Well-structured and commented code for easy understanding.
Flexibility: Can be easily adapted to different price tables and rod lengths.
Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
Run the executable and enter the number of rod lengths, prices, and the desired rod length.
The program will output the maximum value that can be obtained by cutting the rod.
